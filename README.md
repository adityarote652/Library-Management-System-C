# Library Management System 📚

A menu-driven Console Application built using the **C Language** to simulate the core operations of a college library. This project was developed as a Mini-Project for the **First Year Engineering (IT)** curriculum at **MVP'S KBT COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, NASHIK**.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Stock Management:** Add new books and track live inventory quantity.

* **Smart Updates:** Automatically decreases stock when a book is issued and increases it upon return.
* **Transaction Log:** specific menu option to view a register of all currently issued books.
* **Input Validation:** Prevents crashes by validating numeric inputs.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Language:** C (Standard)
* **Data Structures:** Uses **Arrays of Structures** for efficient in-memory data management.
* **Logic:** Implements `switch-case` for menu navigation and loops for data traversal.

## 💻 How to Run
1.  Download the `miniproject2.c` file.
2.  Open it in any C compiler (VS Code, GCC, TurboC).
3.  Compile and Run.
4.  Follow the numeric menu on the console.
